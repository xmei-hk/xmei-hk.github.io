  abstract={Integrating General Models (GMs) such as Large Language Models (LLMs), with Specialized Models (SMs) in autonomous driving tasks presents a promising approach to mitigating challenges in data diversity and model capacity of existing specialized driving models. However, this integration leads to problems of asynchronous systems, which arise from the distinct characteristics inherent in GMs and SMs. To tackle this challenge, we propose NetRoller, an adapter that incorporates a set of novel mechanisms to facilitate the seamless integration of GMs and specialized driving models. Specifically, our mechanisms for interfacing the asynchronous GMs and SMs are organized into three key stages. NetRoller first harvests semantically rich and computationally efficient representations from the reasoning processes of LLMs using an early stopping mechanism, which preserves critical insights on driving context while maintaining low overhead. It then applies learnable query embeddings, nonsensical embeddings, and positional layer embeddings to facilitate robust and efficient cross-modality translation. At last, it employs computationally efficient Query Shift and Feature Shift mechanisms to enhance the performance of SMs through few-epoch fine-tuning. Based on the mechanisms formalized in these three stages, NetRoller enables specialized driving models to operate at their native frequencies while maintaining situational awareness of the GM. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating GM through NetRoller significantly improves human similarity and safety in planning tasks, and it also achieves noticeable precision improvements in detection and mapping tasks for end-to-end autonomous driving.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
