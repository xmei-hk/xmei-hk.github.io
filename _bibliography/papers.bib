  abstract={Motion forecasting represents a critical challenge in autonomous driving systems, requiring accurate prediction of surrounding agents' future trajectories. While existing approaches predict future motion states with the extracted scene context feature from historical agent trajectories and road layouts, they suffer from the information degradation during the scene feature encoding. To address the limitation, we propose HAMF, a novel motion forecasting framework that learns future motion representations with the scene context encoding jointly, to coherently combine the scene understanding and future motion state prediction. We first embed the observed agent states and map information into 1D token sequences, together with the target multi-modal future motion features as a set of learnable tokens. Then we design a unified Attention-based encoder, which synergistically combines self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to model the scene context information and aggregate future motion features jointly. Complementing the encoder, we implement the Mamba module in the decoding stage to further preserve the consistency and correlations among the learned future motion representations, to generate the accurate and diverse final trajectories. Extensive experiments on Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that our hybrid Attention-Mamba model achieves state-of-the-art motion forecasting performance with the simple and lightweight architecture.},

  abstract={This study explores the application of self-supervised learning (SSL) to the task of motion forecasting, an area that has not yet been extensively investigated despite the widespread success of SSL in computer vision and natural language processing. To address this gap, we introduce Forecast-MAE, an extension of the mask autoencoders framework that is specifically designed for self-supervised learning of the motion forecasting task. Our approach includes a novel masking strategy that leverages the strong interconnections between agents' trajectories and road networks, involving complementary masking of agents' future or history trajectories and random masking of lane segments. Our experiments on the challenging Argoverse 2 motion forecasting benchmark show that Forecast-MAE, which utilizes standard Transformer blocks with minimal inductive bias, achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods that rely on supervised learning and sophisticated designs. Moreover, it outperforms the previous self-supervised learning method by a significant margin. Code is available at https://github. com/jchengai/forecast-mae.},

  abstract={Pedestrian trajectory prediction is of great importance for downstream tasks, such as autonomous driving and mobile robot navigation. Realistic models of the social interactions within the crowd is crucial for accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction. However, most existing methods do not capture group level interactions well, focusing only on pairwise interactions and neglecting group-wise interactions. In this work, we propose a hierarchical graph convolutional network, HGCN-GJS, for trajectory prediction which well leverages group level interactions within the crowd. Furthermore, we introduce a joint sampling scheme that captures co-dependencies between pedestrian trajectories during trajectory generation. Based on group information, this scheme ensures that generated trajectories within each group are consistent with each other, but enables different groups to act more independently. We demonstrate that our proposed network achieves state of the art performance on all datasets we have considered.},

Most traditional methods in this area are based on motion equations derived by the understanding of vehicle dynamics, which is difficult to be modeled precisely. We propose a robust drift controller without explicit motion equations, which is based on the latest model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm soft actor-critic. The drift control problem is formulated as a trajectory following task, where the error-based state and reward are designed. After being trained on tracks with different levels of difficulty, our controller is capable of making the vehicle drift through various sharp corners quickly and stably in the unseen map. The proposed controller is further shown to have excellent generalization ability, which can directly handle unseen vehicle types with different physical properties, such as mass, tire friction, etc.},

However, due to the absence of a standardized benchmark, the effectiveness of various designs remains unclear. The newly released nuPlan addresses this issue by offering a large-scale real-world dataset and a standardized closed-loop benchmark for equitable comparisons. Utilizing this platform, we conduct a comprehensive study on two fundamental yet underexplored aspects of imitation-based planners: the essential features for ego planning and the effective data augmentation techniques to reduce compounding errors. Furthermore, we highlight an imitation gap that has been overlooked by current learning systems. Finally, integrating our findings, we propose a strong baseline modelâ€”PlanTF. Our results demonstrate that a well-designed, purely imitation-based planner can achieve highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods involving hand-crafted rules and exhibit superior generalization capabilities in long-tail cases. Our models and benchmarks are publicly available.}

  abstract={Integrating General Models (GMs) such as Large Language Models (LLMs), with Specialized Models (SMs) in autonomous driving tasks presents a promising approach to mitigating challenges in data diversity and model capacity of existing specialized driving models. However, this integration leads to problems of asynchronous systems, which arise from the distinct characteristics inherent in GMs and SMs. To tackle this challenge, we propose NetRoller, an adapter that incorporates a set of novel mechanisms to facilitate the seamless integration of GMs and specialized driving models. Specifically, our mechanisms for interfacing the asynchronous GMs and SMs are organized into three key stages. NetRoller first harvests semantically rich and computationally efficient representations from the reasoning processes of LLMs using an early stopping mechanism, which preserves critical insights on driving context while maintaining low overhead. It then applies learnable query embeddings, nonsensical embeddings, and positional layer embeddings to facilitate robust and efficient cross-modality translation. At last, it employs computationally efficient Query Shift and Feature Shift mechanisms to enhance the performance of SMs through few-epoch fine-tuning. Based on the mechanisms formalized in these three stages, NetRoller enables specialized driving models to operate at their native frequencies while maintaining situational awareness of the GM. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating GM through NetRoller significantly improves human similarity and safety in planning tasks, and it also achieves noticeable precision improvements in detection and mapping tasks for end-to-end autonomous driving.},

      abstract={Decision-making and planning in autonomous driving critically reflect the safety of the system, making effective planning imperative. Current imitation learning-based planning algorithms often merge historical trajectories with present observations to predict future candidate paths. However, these algorithms typically assess the current and historical plans independently, leading to discontinuities in driving intentions and an accumulation of errors with each step in a discontinuous plan. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces LHPF, an imitation learning planner that integrates historical planning information. Our approach employs a historical intention aggregation module that pools historical planning intentions, which are then combined with a spatial query vector to decode the final planning trajectory. Furthermore, we incorporate a comfort auxiliary task to enhance the human-like quality of the driving behavior. Extensive experiments using both real-world and synthetic data demonstrate that LHPF not only surpasses existing advanced learning-based planners in planning performance but also marks the first instance of a purely learning-based planner outperforming the expert. Additionally, the application of the historical intention aggregation module across various backbones highlights the considerable potential of the proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.},

  abstract={Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for safe and efficient autonomous driving, 
  but handling partial observations presents significant challenges. To address this, 
  we propose a novel trajectory prediction framework called Partial Observations Prediction (POP) for congested urban road scenarios. 
  The framework consists of two key stages: self-supervised learning (SSL) and feature distillation. 
  POP first employs SLL to help the model learn to reconstruct history representations, 
  and then utilizes feature distillation as the fine-tuning task to transfer knowledge from the teacher model, 
  which has been pre-trained with complete observations, to the student model, which has only few observations. 
  POP achieves comparable results to topperforming methods in open-loop experiments and outperforms the baseline method in closed-loop simulations, 
  including safety metrics. Qualitative results illustrate the superiority of POP in providing reasonable and safe trajectory predictions.},
