Greetings! I’m Xiaodong MEI, a final year Ph.D. candidate at **the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology** (HKUST). I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Dan XU](https://www.danxurgb.net/) and pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the Cheng Kar-Shun Robotics Institute (CKSRI) and the Intelligent and Autonomous Driving Center (IADC).

Before joining HKUST, I completed my Bachelor's degree with the supervision of Prof.[Yongsheng OU](https://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/ouyongsheng/en/index.htm) in Computer Science and Technology at **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences** (UCAS), China.

My primary research field is **learning based motion prediction and planning in autonomous driving**, and my research interests span **reinforcement learning**, **VLM/VLA**, **imitation learning**， **self-supervised learning** and related fields. I am passionate about exploring cutting-edge technologies in robotics and aim to push the limitations of data-driven approaches for building more human-like and safer intelligent agents in real life.

<p style="color: blue;">I’m currently looking for a job (both full time and intern) or a postdoc position, please feel free to drop me an email for any opportunities.
